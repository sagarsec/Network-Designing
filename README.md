# Network-Designing-Using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
I designed a sample network for an Enterprise.   
This Enterprise has 2 Locations (Location A & Location B).
It is a of Secure Campus Area Network where in Location B, there is a Main Server with IP of 172.18.51.1. Only PC0 to PC5 can Access this server. They can't ping it but they can access the web service.
